 * JavaDoc comments consist of two separate parts: the main the description and the block tags. After the first block
 * tag, no regular text may follow. Doxygen does not have this strict structure. We therefore can't append everything
 * from the Doxygen comment in order. Instead, we maintain two StringBuilders to be able to append to the main text and
 * the block tags separately. We have an additional StringBuilder for Doxygen block tags that do not exist in JavaDoc,
 * and are instead appended to the end of the main text (and so before the other block tags).
